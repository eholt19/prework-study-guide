# Pre-Work Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As I'm entering the world of coding for the first time, there is a lot of new information to keep track of! I created this project to help me keep this information together and organized.
While I learn more about HTML, Git, CSS and JavaScript, I can add to the information on this webpage and will be able to use it as a guide, no matter where I am.
This is my first project using HTML, Git, CSS and JavaScript. I've learned the very beginning steps of each of these elements in order to create this project and I look forward to adding even more to my knowledge.

## Usage

On this webpage is a short collection of my notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. I've made sure that each topic is organized so that you can easily figure out which notes are which.
While on this webpage, you can open the DevTools console to see that the JavaScript is running. I have programed this to randomly select one of the four topics to study each time the page is loaded.
